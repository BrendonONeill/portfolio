# Portfolio

I initially created my first portfolio using Wix, but as I gained experience in web development, I began
using a variety of frameworks and libraries. Over time, I became more comfortable coding websites from
scratch with raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This motivated me to rebuild my portfolio with cleaner, more
efficient code and updated CSS styles. The portfolio now showcases my projects, designs, and highlights
the skills Iâ€™ve developed over the past few years, serving as a personal reflection of my growth as a
web developer.
